Mix well to form a smooth marinade.\n\n2. **Marinate the Salmon:**  \n   Pat the salmon fillets dry with a paper towel. Spread the miso marinade over the surface of both fillets, coating them thoroughly. Allow to marinate in the fridge for 15\u201320 minutes while you prepare the vegetables.\n\n3. **Prepare the Vegetables:**  \n   Cut your broccoli, carrot, and green beans. Set up a pot with a steamer basket (or use a heatproof colander placed over boiling water). Steam the veggies for about 7\u20138 minutes, or until just tender but still bright and crisp.\n\n4. **Cook the Salmon:**  \n   Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Remove excess marinade from the salmon (leave a thin layer on the surface). Place fillets in the skillet and sear for about 3 minutes on each side, or until the salmon flakes easily with a fork and is nicely glazed. You can also cook the salmon under a broiler for 5\u20137 minutes if you prefer.\n\n5. **Serve:**  \n   Divide the steamed vegetables between two plates. Place a miso-glazed salmon fillet on each plate. Squeeze fresh lemon over the salmon and vegetables. Sprinkle with green onion slices and sesame seeds if desired.\n\n**Enjoy your healthy, flavorful Japanese miso salmon dinner!**\n\n**Estimated Calories per Serving:** Approximately 320\u2013350 kcal."}]}}
