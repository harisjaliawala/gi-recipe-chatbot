Here\u2019s a classic Japanese dinner for two: **Chicken Teriyaki with Steamed Rice**\u2014absolutely no pork or pork products.\n\n## Chicken Teriyaki with Steamed Rice\n\n**Gut Health Tags:** Simple proteins, Gluten-Optional  \n**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes  \n**Servings:** 2  \n\n---\n### Ingredients\n- 2 skinless, boneless chicken thighs (about 8 oz total)\n- 1 tablespoon neutral oil (e.g., avocado or canola)\n- 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce (use coconut aminos or tamari for gluten-free)\n- 2 tablespoons mirin (Japanese sweet rice wine)\n- 1 tablespoon honey or maple syrup\n- 1 tablespoon rice vinegar\n- 1/2 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated\n- 1 cup uncooked short-grain white rice (such as sushi rice)\n- 2 cups water\n- 1 small green onion, green part only, thinly sliced (optional, \u26a0\ufe0f may be a mild GI trigger for sensitive individuals)\n- 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds (optional)\n\n---\n### Equipment Needed\n- Medium saucepan with lid\n- Nonstick skillet or frying pan\n- Small bowl\n- Measuring cups and spoons\n\n---\n### Instructions\n\n1. **Cook the Rice:**  \n   - Rinse 1 cup uncooked rice thoroughly under cold water until water runs clear.\n   - Combine rinsed rice and 2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a gentle boil, then cover and reduce heat to low.  \n   - Simmer for 15 minutes, then remove from heat (keep lid on) and let rest for 10 minutes.\n\n2. **Make the Teriyaki Sauce:**  \n   - In a small bowl, mix soy sauce, mirin, honey, rice vinegar, and grated ginger.\n\n3. **Prepare & Cook Chicken:**  \n   - Pat chicken thighs dry. Heat oil in skillet over medium heat.\n   - Add chicken and cook 4\u20135 minutes each side, until chicken is golden and fully cooked (internal temp 165\u00b0F).\n\n4. **Add Sauce & Glaze:**  \n   - Pour sauce into pan with chicken.  \n   - Simmer 2\u20133 minutes, spooning sauce over chicken, until sauce thickens and glazes.\n\n5. **Serve:**  \n   - Fluff rice and divide into 2 bowls or plates.\n   - Slice chicken and place over rice. Drizzle extra teriyaki sauce from pan.\n   - Garnish with green onion \u26a0\ufe0f and toasted sesame seeds if desired.\n\n---\n### Why This Is Gut-Friendly\nThis meal offers simple protein and easily digestible white rice. Cooking the chicken without frying helps reduce inflammation. The teriyaki sauce is homemade to avoid additives found in bottled sauces.\n\n---\n### Optional Swaps\n- **Gluten-Free:** Use tamari or coconut aminos instead of soy sauce.\n- **Vegetarian:** Substitute chicken with firm tofu, pressed and pan-seared.\n- **Lower Sugar:** Use half the honey or maple syrup, or skip mirin.\n\n---\n_Reminder: This guidance is informational and not a substitute for individual medical advice.
